## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the Officer dashboard up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed.
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Set up the Backend Services**:
    You need to run two separate backend servers. Open two terminal windows for this.

    *   **Terminal 1: Environmental Control**
        ```sh
        cd Climate
        pip install Flask Flask-Cors
        python main.py
        ```
        This server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

    *   **Terminal 2: Parking Management**
        ```sh
        cd Parking
        pip install Flask Flask-Cors
        python main.py
        ```
        This server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.

2.  **Launch the Frontend**:
    -   Navigate to the root `OfficeApp` directory.
    -   Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.

You should now see the "Officer" dashboard, and both panels should load their respective data from the running services.
