# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: .
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
    volumes:
      - ./main.py:/app/main.py # Mounts the main entrypoint for live changes
      - ./Backend:/app/Backend # Mounts the backend package for live changes
# The 'db' and 'volumes' sections have been removed as we are using a cloud database.
# Ensure your .env file has the correct MONGO_URI for your cloud instance.
